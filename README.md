# CSE112-22-Assignment-SimpleAssemblerSimulator
Created a RISC Assembler and Simulator, which operates on a custom 16-bit instruction set architecture. It also provides a memory visualization after each instruction is executed.
Languages and technologies Used: ASM, Python, Git Bash, and Automated testing.

This repository holds the frame of your project.
Please download the entire folder and make no modifications to the frame.
Just add your files in the right directory, and modify the run files according to need.


Add your source code file for the assembler in the folder named SimpleAssembler
Add your source code file for the simulator in the folder named SimpleSimulator

Naming Convention for the source files: SimpleAssembler, SimpleSimulator.

Based on the laguage you use, change the run files in SimpleSimulator and SimpleAssembler folders accordingly.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUN FILE: All the run files need to be granted permission/privelidge for execution.
Eg. for Linux-systems, go to the folder of each run file using bash/terminal and write "chmod +x run" {without quotes}.

To run the results for your assembler, go to Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permisions to the run file, type "./run --no-sim" {without quotes}.

To run the results for your simulator, go to Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permisions to the run file, type "./run --no-asm" {without quotes}.

To run the results for both,, the assembler and the simulator, go to Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permisions to the run file, type "./run" or "./run --verbose" [for verbose output] {without quotes}.
